# 🌟 Pancreas scRNA-seq Reference Atlas Project 🌟

## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to our *group 5* project repository! 🧬 This project is all about charting new territories in the pancreas using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We're on a mission to conquer the challenges of batch effect correction and data high-dimensionality in scRNA-seq with some seriously advanced computational firepower! 💻

## 🛠 Methods
We've deployed three main computational wizards:
1. **Unsupervised Clustering (MNN + KMeans)**: 🔍 Identifying distinct cell types.
2. **GLM with Lasso Penalty**: 📐 Enhancing feature selection.
3. **Multi-Task Neural Network**: 🧠 A top-notch approach for cell type classification.

### 📈 Important Formula
One of our key formulas is the **GLM with Lasso Penalty**:

*Where X is the feature matrix, Y is the response vector, and alpha = 1 implies the lasso penalty.*

## 🌌 Results
Behold the power of our methods, especially the multi-task neural network, in classifying cell types with astronomical accuracy! 🌠
